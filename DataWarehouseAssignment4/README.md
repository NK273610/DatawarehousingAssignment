# DataWarehouseAssignment4

In this assignment we were asked to create graphs in order to visualize the data. To complete this assignment we have used Tableau, So in order please download the tableau tool and open file ***Book1.twb*** to view the graphs. We have also uploaded the data file that we used for making different visualizations in tableau. The dashboard has five different graphs for five queries given in the assignment. 

We have also implemented 2 graphs in python matplotlib but as were not seeing more visually appealing graph we switched to tableau. In order to see out histogram and geo-spatial implementation using matplotlib please check file ***graphs.py***.
